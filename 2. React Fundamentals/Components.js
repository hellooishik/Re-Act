//  Components: Understand Functional and Class Components




//  What are Components?
// Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component is a self-contained piece of the UI that can be reused and composed with other components to build a complex UI. There are two types of components in React: Functional Components and Class Components.




//  Functional Components
// Functional components are simpler and more straightforward. They are just JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements. Functional components do not have state or lifecycle methods until the introduction of React Hooks.

import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;


// With React Hooks, functional components can manage state and side effects.

// Example with Hooks:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;


//  Class Components
// Class components are more feature-rich. They can hold and manage their own state and have access to lifecycle methods. Class components are ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component`.


import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

export default Welcome;


// Class components can manage state and use lifecycle methods.

// Example with State and Lifecycle Methods:


import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Component did mount');
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log('Component did update');
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log('Component will unmount');
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

#### Key Differences between Functional and Class Components
- **Syntax:** Functional components are simpler and written as functions. Class components are written as ES6 classes.
- **State and Lifecycle:** Functional components didn't have state or lifecycle methods before Hooks. Class components have state and lifecycle methods built-in.
- **Hooks:** With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can now manage state and side effects, making them more powerful and comparable to class components.

#### When to Use Functional vs. Class Components
- **Functional Components:** Use functional components when you don't need state or lifecycle methods. With Hooks, you can also use them when you need state and side effects.
- **Class Components:** Use class components if you're working with older codebases or libraries that require class components. However, with the adoption of Hooks, the need for class components has decreased.

### Summary
Both functional and class components serve the same purpose: to create reusable pieces of UI. Functional components are simpler and preferred for their readability and ease of use, especially with the introduction of Hooks. Class components are more feature-rich and provide built-in state and lifecycle methods, but they are more verbose and complex.
